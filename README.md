# Capital Bike Share Demand Forecasting

This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting the demand for bicycles using the **Capital Bike Share** dataset. The goal is to leverage machine learning models to help **Capital Bike Share** improve their services by predicting future demand based on factors such as time of day, day of the week, season, and weather conditions.

## Project Overview

The dataset used for this project comes from **Capital Bike Share**, a bike-sharing program based in Washington D.C. Bike-sharing programs like Capital Bike Share have become increasingly popular as cities aim to reduce traffic congestion, promote sustainable transport, and provide convenient alternatives to traditional commuting. By predicting demand for bikes, bike-sharing services can optimize operations, improve fleet management, and enhance user experience.

### Objective:
The main objective of this project is to:
- **Analyze** the factors that influence bike demand, such as time, weather, and seasonal trends.
- **Develop predictive models** to forecast the number of bikes required at different times of the day or week.
- **Visualize** areas of high and low demand using mapping techniques.
- **Provide actionable insights** that can help improve the operational efficiency of the Capital Bike Share program.

## Dataset Information

The dataset used for this project is the **full dataset** of Capital Bike Share, which contains information about ride-level details. The dataset includes features such as:
- Date and time of the ride
- Weather conditions
- Temperature, humidity, and season
- Day of the week and hour of the day
- The number of bikes rented and returned

You can access the dataset from **Google Drive**. The file is stored as `CBS_2021-2023_Full.csv` and should be placed in your project directory to run the analysis.

### How to Access the Data
1. Download the dataset from [Google Drive](http://bit.ly/3Z1pzFJ).
   - The dataset is stored in a CSV file: `CBS_2021-2023_Full.csv`.
   - You may need to request access if the link is restricted.

2. After downloading, place the CSV file in the project directory where the Python scripts are located.

## Tools and Techniques
- **Python** for data analysis and machine learning model development.
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn for data analysis and visualization, Scikit-learn for machine learning, and Folium/Plotly for mapping visualizations.
- **Modeling**: Experiment with regression models, time series forecasting, and other machine learning techniques to predict bike demand.

## Project Steps:
1. **Data Exploration & Cleaning**: Analyze the dataset, handle missing data, remove outliers, and engineer relevant features.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explore relationships between features and bike demand using statistical analysis and visualizations.
3. **Model Building**: Develop machine learning models to predict bike demand. Try different models and evaluate their performance.
4. **Visualization**: Use mapping techniques to visualize areas of high and low demand, and identify patterns in bike usage across different times and locations.
5. **Insights & Recommendations**: Provide actionable insights that can assist Capital Bike Share in improving operations, increasing efficiency, and enhancing user experience.

## End Goal:
By the end of this project, the goal is to have a predictive model (or models) capable of accurately forecasting demand for bikes. The model(s) can be used by Capital Bike Share to optimize the availability of bikes across different stations, improve service delivery, and better plan for periods of high or low demand.
